# Cities Frontend
This is the best City temperature tracker in the world.

## Usage
* By default, the application displays a list of 10 Cities in the world, plus the current temperature.
* Additional cities can be added by name.

## Architecture
This web application is implemented via Angular 10. The `CityComponent` displays the Cityâ€™s name and
temperature, while the main `AppComponent` displays a list of all cities and the input field for
adding other entries to the list.

The data is retrieved by the `CityService`, which issue a `GET` request to the backend server upon
start. If a new City is added, the service sends a `PUT` request and the result is added to the list.

## Know problems
* If a City is already in the list and the user adds it again, the backend server will not store the city twice. However, it still will return the cityâ€™s data, which might cause this web app to add the city to the list, resulting in a duplicated entry. This should be gone after refreshing the page though.
* There is no error handling implemented at the moment, which means if the backend service goes away the user will not retrieve any useful error message.

## Ideas
* Something like bootstrap could be added to the website, so it does not look like a 1993â€˜s webpage.
* A delete button next to each city name could be added.
* If more weather data would be made available by the backend server, little emojis could be used to indicate the current weather â›…ðŸŒ§.
* A link to `wttr.in` could be added to retrieve the complete report.
* The input field could support some kind of auto-completion for city names.
